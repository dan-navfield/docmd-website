    question: "How do I convert markdown to a Word document?",
    answer:
      "Paste or type your markdown into the editor on the left. You'll see a live preview on the right. When you're happy with it, click the Convert button. Your .docx file downloads instantly — no account needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What markdown features are supported?",
    answer:
      "DocMD handles headings, bold, italic, links, images, bullet and numbered lists, tables, code blocks with syntax highlighting, blockquotes, and horizontal rules. Basically everything you'd write in a README or project doc.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a file size or character limit?",
    answer:
      "The free converter supports documents up to 10,000 characters per conversion — plenty for most single documents. Need to convert longer files or process batches? DocMD Pro removes all limits.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private and secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your markdown is sent over HTTPS to our conversion API and discarded immediately after your .docx is generated. We don't store, log, or train on your content. Ever.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this work on mobile devices?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. The converter is fully responsive. On smaller screens you toggle between the editor and preview panels. The convert and download flow works the same way.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the output .docx file look like?",
    answer:
      "Clean, professional formatting with proper heading hierarchy, styled tables, formatted code blocks, and consistent typography. It opens perfectly in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use custom templates or branding?",
    answer:
      "The free converter uses DocMD's default professional template. DocMD Pro lets you upload custom templates with your fonts, colors, headers, footers, and logo — every conversion matches your brand.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an account to convert files?",
    answer:
      "No. You get 3 free conversions with no signup. After that, create a free account for more, or upgrade to Pro for unlimited conversions, batch processing, and custom templates.",
  },
